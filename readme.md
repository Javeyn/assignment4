# quiz game

## a project by Jack Sorensen

This project was a lot of fun once I realized what I was doing wrong with DOM manipulation. I think you will see when going through my javascript that I am at least grasping the basics of what it is and how it is supposed to work. 

In many places, my code is very wet. I can see where the whole project would be tightened up massively by using arrays, for loops, and DOM manipulation, but I wanted to at least get it to the point where it functions like a quiz.

The timer starts and counts down, and if it reaches 0 it will bring you to the score page, but I couldnt figure out how exactly to get incorrect answers to subtract time from the remaining timer.

I also need to work on scorekeeping and local storage as well. That shouldnt be too difficult, but I need to turn this in for a better grade as is, and move onto the next project. 

### resources

For text I used google fonts. To make your life easier to navigate through my code, styleTEST and Script are the only two links attached that you will need to browse through. feel free to look through the other code if you would like, but it is a jarbled mess that doesnt work at all.
